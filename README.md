Artemis Financial and their requirements:

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They wanted to modernize their operations and enhance the security of their web application, specifically by adding a file verification step using a checksum to ensure secure communications.

Addressing software security vulnerabilities:

I did well in identifying security vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices to mitigate them. Secure coding is crucial to protect sensitive data, maintain a company's reputation, and avoid potential legal issues. Software security adds value by improving customer trust, ensuring compliance, reducing costs, and providing a competitive advantage.

Vulnerability assessment challenges and helpful aspects:

The most challenging aspect was analyzing the existing code to identify vulnerabilities while ensuring the application's functionality. The OWASP Dependency-Check Maven static testing and manual code review were helpful in pinpointing areas of improvement.

Increasing layers of security and future assessments:

I increased layers of security by implementing SHA-256 hashing, generating self-signed certificates, enabling HTTPS, and using RESTful APIs. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, or Veracode to assess vulnerabilities and apply the most effective mitigation techniques based on industry best practices.

Ensuring functionality and security:

After refactoring the code, I tested the application to ensure it remained functional and secure. I used the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven static testing to check whether new vulnerabilities were introduced, and I manually reviewed the code for any potential issues.

Helpful resources, tools, and coding practices:

I found resources like OWASP guides, Java Keytool, Eclipse IDE, and Maven Dependency Check helpful in this assignment. Secure coding practices, such as input validation, secure communications, and following industry best practices, will be beneficial in future tasks.

Showing work to future employers:

From this assignment, I showcase my ability to refactor code, implement secure coding practices, identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and enhance the security of an existing application. The integration of checksum verification and secure communication with HTTPS serves as an example of my skills and knowledge in secure software development.
